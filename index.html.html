<center><p>My name is Yusuf Urur, I’m 23 years old born and raised in Toronto, Ontario. I Currently attend<br />
NPower Canada program and soon to be fully certified in MTA & ISTQB.<br /></p></center>

<!--I added in the paragraph element inside the body so the text would appear on the web page.-->
<center><p> I am a first generation Somali Canadian and I come from a large family consisting of 8. Coming from <br />
a large family taught me to be both patient and family oriented. My parents emigrated from Somali in the 1990s <br />
fleeing from a civil war. Learning about the struggles both my parents faced to immigrate from a war torn country<br />
to Canada for a better life, plays a significant role in the man I am today.  The opportunities that my siblings<br />
and I have received all our lives taught me to be extremely grateful and optimistic at all times because it can<br /> always be worse.</p></center>

<center><p>At a young age I always knew I would grow to enjoy learning and working with different types of<br />
electronics. Like a normal growing boy I went through phases of trying new things, one phase being trying to<br />
learn how all the electronics and computers we use on a daily basis work. Luckily for me it turned out to be a<br />
phase I never out grew. That’s when I started to research different Information technology programs.  The NPower<br /> program has given me the opportunity to learn more about the IT industry and different coding languages.  So far,<br /> the languages that I have been taught are C#, Java, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Not only have I been taught<br />
thetech part of the program, but I have also been working on my soft skills as well. The tools that I have been<br />
given and the willingness to learn and explore new things will lead me to the direction to being successful in the<br />
IT industry.</p></center>
